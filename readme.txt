Tidy dataset

runAnalysis.R runs a script that takes the original dataset (from here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip but already contained in this repository) and converts it into a tidy dataset. 

Information on the dataset transformation is available in CodeBook.md
